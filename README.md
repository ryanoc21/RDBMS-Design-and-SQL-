# RDBMS-Design-and-SQL 
This is my full final project for my Information Systems module @ TU Dublin. I received a grade of 98% for this piece of work. It covers a conceptual 
design for a relational database for an airport. A full process of normalisation was also carried out. Finally, fake data were created to implement the 
database in MySQL. A wide array of SQL queries were carried out, along with the creation of various indexes and a dump file.
